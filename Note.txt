ü§î What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

For these applications, LangChain simplifies the entire application lifecycle:

Open-source libraries:  Build your applications using LangChain's open-source building blocks, components, and third-party integrations.
Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.

Productionization: Inspect, monitor, and evaluate your apps with LangSmith so that you can constantly optimize and deploy with confidence.

Deployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Cloud.

Open-source libraries

langchain-core: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.

langchain-community: Third party integrations.

Some integrations have been further split into partner packages that only rely on langchain-core. Examples include langchain_openai and langchain_anthropic.

langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.

LangGraph: A library for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.

Productionization:

LangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.

Deployment:

LangGraph Cloud: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants.

üöÄ How does LangChain help?

The main value props of the LangChain libraries are:
1. Components: composable building blocks, tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
2. Off-the-shelf chains: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones.

LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)

LCEL is the foundation of many of LangChain's components, and is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest ‚Äúprompt + LLM‚Äù chain to the most complex chains.

Overview: LCEL and its benefits

Interface: The standard Runnable interface for LCEL objects

Primitives: More on the primitives LCEL includes

Cheatsheet: Quick overview of the most common usage patterns

Components

Components fall into the following modules:

üìÉ Model I/O

This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, a generic interface for chat models and LLMs, and common utilities for working with model outputs.

üìö Retrieval

Retrieval Augmented Generation involves loading data from a variety of sources, preparing it, then searching over (a.k.a. retrieving from) it for use in the generation step.

ü§ñ Agents

Agents allow an LLM autonomy over how a task is accomplished. Agents make decisions about which Actions to take, then take that Action, observe the result, and repeat until the task is complete. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, along with LangGraph for building custom agents.
